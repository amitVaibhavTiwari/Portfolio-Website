# Developer Portfolio Template (Next.js + TailwindCSS)

A clean, modern and fully responsive portfolio template, the same one I use. Perfect for showcasing your bio, projects, skills, education, and work experience.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amitVaibhavTiwari/Portfolio-Website.git
cd portfolio-website
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or, using yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

Or, using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Start development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is already in use).

## 📝 Configuration

### Customizing Your Portfolio

All your personal information and portfolio content is managed through a single configuration file located at `src/portfolio_config.ts`.

Edit this file to add your personal details, project information, skills, education and work experience.

### Customizing the Navigation Dock

The Navigation dock is located inside `src/components/FloatingDock` folder. 

Icons and navigation on the dock can be changed via DockItems.tsx file inside this folder.

You can add new files for additional snippets or modify existing ones.
